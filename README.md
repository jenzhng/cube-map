# Cube Map Visualization

This project demonstrates a 3D cube map visualization using Three.js. The visualization features a 3D cube where each face is textured with panoramic images, allowing users to explore a skybox effect with interactive controls.

## Features

- **3D Cube Map**: Visualizes a 3D cube where each face is textured with a panoramic image.
- **Interactive Controls**: Allows users to alter surface roughness and metallic value to see real-time changes.
- **Skybox Effect**: The cube map uses a skybox image to enhance the 3D experience.
